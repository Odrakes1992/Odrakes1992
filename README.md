<h1 align="center"> Howdy ðŸ‘‹ I am Osneil </h1>

<h3 align="center"> I was a Historian, then I became a Tax Advisor and now I am a Software Engineer. </h3>

Hello again, as the tag line notes my name is Osneil. It also says that I was a historian, which is a slight stretch, I did study history at university and it was my first love, so technically still a historian.

I actually really enjoyed my degree and to this day it still is a surprise that I am not in academia, but I was lured by a career in professional services. The books were a lot bigger this time but the processes still the same. Whilst the topics were very different, it was another opportunity to learn new stuff. 

And that's what I've discovered, I really like to learn new stuff and I put that down to the historian in me. My degree started me down a path of learning and here I am as a software developer, which is very apt because apparently software developers never stop learning so if there was a career to change into this would be the one.

### ðŸ’» Tech Experience

I finished the Makers Academy Bootcamp in November 2021, time has been flying. The bootcamp focussed on Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and Agile software development using some of the stack shown above. I also picked up some mentees along the way - 4 and counting!

For a full breakdown of my experience have a look at my linkedin, I am currently working in climate and building some cool stuff with some folks at <a href="https://www.climatepolicyradar.org/what-we-do" target="_blank"> Climate Policy Radar </a>
